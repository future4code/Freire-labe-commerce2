# Labecommerce - Freire (Labenu)

E-commerce built with ReactJS.

The website (web application) was a demand of the Front-End course, in order to use all the technologies taught until then.

It simulates a space-themed shirt store website, and required the following conditions:
  - User-friendly interface;
  - Product listing on the home screen;
  - Search bar;
  - Filters to sort the products;
  - Shopping cart with listing, item exclusion and calculation of values;
  - Everything else that was possible to do;
